everything probably works perfectly unless if it runs out of memory
incorrect inputs are either partially interpreted or just ignored
all maps print with x+y location on grid and seed for recreating
it doesn't matter if it generates new maps every time or if it saves them
main.c is main
grid.c/h manages map pointers and exits
map.c/h manages printing maps and calling the generators
terrain.c/h generates terrain
buildings.c/h generates buildings
roads_and_boarder.c/h generates roads and the boarder
